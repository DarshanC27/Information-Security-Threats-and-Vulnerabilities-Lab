C|CT Module Notes â€“ Information Security Threats & Vulnerabilities

These notes summarize key learnings from the EC-Council Certified Cybersecurity Technician (C|CT) course.

## Topics Covered:
- Security Threats vs Vulnerabilities
- Malware Types: Trojan, Virus, Worm, Spyware
- Exploit Databases & Vulnerability Research
- Defensive Security Measures

## Key Takeaways:
- Always differentiate between a **threat** (potential attack) and a **vulnerability** (weakness).  
- Malware techniques vary but often overlap in infection and persistence.  
- Exploit-DB and CVE databases are valuable for **threat intelligence**.  
- **Defense-in-Depth** (Firewall + IDS/IPS + EDR + Patching + User Awareness) is critical.
