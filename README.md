# Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities Lab

This repository contains documentation of my hands-on labs exploring **cybersecurity threats, malware behavior, and vulnerability analysis**.  
It is based on exercises from the EC-Council *Certified Cybersecurity Technician (C|CT)* curriculum and adapted into a **defensive and educational perspective**.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This repository is strictly for **educational and research purposes only**.  
No malicious code is shared here. Instead, it provides detailed lab walkthroughs, screenshots, analysis, and defensive measures to help understand how attacks work and how to defend against them.

## 🔹 Lab Topics Covered
1. **Trojan Analysis** – Understanding Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and how attackers gain system control.  
2. **Computer Viruses** – Self-replicating malware and its persistence techniques.  
3. **Worms** – Propagation across networks and botnet creation.  
4. **Spyware & Monitoring** – User activity surveillance techniques and countermeasures.  
5. **Exploit-DB Research** – Discovering vulnerabilities using public exploit databases (CVE mapping).

📚 Learning Outcomes
- ✅ Differentiate between **threats and vulnerabilities**  
- ✅ Understand **malware behavior** (Trojan, Virus, Worm, Spyware)  
- ✅ Document step-by-step lab execution with **screenshots & analysis**  
- ✅ Perform **vulnerability research** using Exploit-DB  
- ✅ Map attacks to **defensive controls** (Firewall, IDS/IPS, EDR, Patch Management)
